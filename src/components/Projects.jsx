      <h3>Generative AI Applications Suite (Ongoing)</h3>
      <p>
        Built AI apps for text generation, summarization, image synthesis
        using OpenAI, Gemini, Groq & HuggingFace APIs.
      </p>
  
      <h3>Smart Traffic Management System</h3>
      <p>
        Real-time pothole detection (SSD), traffic classification (EfficientNet),
        vehicle detection (PyTorch).
      </p>
  
      <h3>Adaptive Traffic Signal Control</h3>
      <p>
        Used YOLO and TensorFlow for real-time traffic density analysis
        and smart signal decisions.
